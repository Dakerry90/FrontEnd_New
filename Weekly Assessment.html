    <p><strong>1. What are some of the different options for jobs for web developers?</strong></p>
    <p><em>Developers might specialize in front-end development, working with clients in the creation of web pages. They also might specialize in back-end development and create the systems that users don't see but that keep the site working. Web developers work on the server-side of web pages. Full-stack developers work on both ends of projects. Most smaller webpages work with full-stack developers. Web developers also work as webmasters, keeping websites up to date, monitoring traffic and solving any issues that arise with the site.</em></p>

    <p><strong>4. What qualities are most important in a web developer?</strong></p>
    <p><em>Beyond having great computer skills, web developers need to have a love of learning.
